<!--
    This file contains the description of some very simple features of Haar-like
    features and will be used as a very simple face detector. The idea is that the
    sum of the pixels in the areas covered by the first rectangle are subtracted
    from the sum of pixels in the second area. If this value is above a certain
    threshold, the rectangle is considered to contain a face.
