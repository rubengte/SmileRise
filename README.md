# 😊 SmileRise – Real-Time Smile Recognition & Frame Capture  
*“When one of us rises… all of us rise together.”*

---

## 🌱 About the Project

**SmileRise** was born from a deep desire to capture authentic human joy — *smiles* — in their most natural, fleeting moments. This is more than a face-detection tool; it’s a **celebration of presence**, of emotion, and of life showing up in all its spontaneity.

In a world flooded with filters and automation, I wanted to create something that honors the real — the *genuine smiles* that rise from within.

This project uses **real-time video processing in the browser** (no server needed) to detect and extract frames containing smiles, with surprising accuracy and a light footprint.

## ✨ The Journey

I started this as a personal exploration. Existing AI models like OpenFace were either inaccurate with smiles or limited in flexibility. I tried switching to Haar cascades and larger files with OpenCV — it felt almost impossible at times, with nothing working. I nearly gave up.

But something inside said: **Keep believing.**

One day, a suggestion sparked: *What if we combine face geometry with smile detection?* That idea — gifted through a moment of conversation with Gemini AI — changed everything. The very first run with that hybrid approach gave me **the most genuine, real smiles** I had ever captured.

And at that exact moment… a plane flew past my window in Madeira, with a heart shape in its vapor trail.

Synchronicity. Magic. Proof that life moves in harmony when we trust it.

## 🌍 Why It’s Open

This project doesn’t belong to me — not really. It came *through* me, like many beautiful things in life do. I’ve chosen to keep it **fully open-source**, because I believe that knowledge, tools, and joy are meant to be shared.

Use it, remix it, build upon it, make it yours. Let it evolve.

## 🔄 Future Vision

This is only the beginning.

Imagine this embedded into cameras, shared with communities, used by filmmakers, artists, therapists — anyone wanting to reconnect with what makes us truly *feel*.

If you have ideas or improvements, I welcome them.  
This isn’t just code. It’s a seed.
